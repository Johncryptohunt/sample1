    <h1>In Love With You</h1>
    <h2>By Regine Velazquez</h2>
    <div class="lyrics">
   <p>Just a gentle whisper
        <br>Told me that you've gone
        <br>Leaving only memories
        <br>Where did we go wrong
        <br>I couldn't find the words
        <br>Then so let me say them now
        <br>I'm still in love with you</p>

    <p>Tell me that you love me
        <br>Tell me that you care
        <br>Tell me that you need me
        <br>And I'll be there
        <br>I'll be there waiting
        <br>I will always love you
        <br>I will always stay true
        <br>There's no one who love
        <br>You like I do
        <br>Come to me now
        <br>I will never leave you
        <br>I will stay here with you
        <br>Through the good and bad
        <br>I will stand true
        <br>I'm in love with you</p>

    <p>Now we're here together
        <br>Yesterday has passed
        <br>Life is just beginning, close to you at last
        <br>And I promise to you
        <br>I will always be there
        <br>I give my all to you
        <br>Living life without you is more than I can bear
        <br>Hold me close forever
        <br>I'll be there
        <br>I'll be there for you
        <br>Hold me closer
        <br>Our love is forever
        <br>Holding us together
        <br>Nothing in this world can stop us now
        <br>Love has found a way, love has found a way
        <br>I'm in love, I'm in love
        <br>Yes, I'm in love, so in love
        <br>I'm in love with you</p>
